Hi, I'm Rodrigo — a software engineer with a degree in Computer Science from [UFSM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_University_of_Santa_Maria) working since 2019.

Currently, I work as a full-stack web developer using C# and ReactJS, leveraging Cloud and AI technologies through Azure. My main specialty lies in code architecture and back-end development.

In this repository, you'll find some of my hobby projects and personal code experiments. Let's take a quick overview:

### Manco (my programming language)

I've always been curious about how programming languages work, but for a long time, I had no idea where to start. Eventually, that curiosity turned into code.
This [project](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/MancoLanguage) took around three months to complete with C# — it's a custom programming language that either compiles to MIPS-based assembly or transpiles to C++. Here's a GIF showcasing it:

### Minecraft with OpenGL from scratch

As a computer graphics enthusiast, I built a Minecraft clone from scratch as the final project for my Advanced Computer Graphics class during graduation.
The terrain is procedurally generated, and you can place and remove blocks just like in the original game. You can check out the project [here](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/MinecraftFromScratch), along with a cool GIF below:

### Software Rasterizer

I've always been curious about how 3D worlds are rendered on 2D screens. To dive deeper into this, I implemented a complete software rasterizer from scratch in C++, running entirely on the CPU.

The [project](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/SoftwareRasterizer) includes everything from 3D transformations and perspective projection to triangle rasterization, depth buffering and lighting. Here's the result:

### Box engine

[BoxEngine](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/BoxEngine) is a hobby game engine designed for building games, especially 2D ones. It follows a game object architecture and uses Lua with a JIT compiler as its scripting language.

While it's still a work in progress and doesn't yet include all the features I have in mind, it's already capable of building 2D games with ease. Let’s take a look:

You can find some games and applications built with this engine here:
- **[Air Fighter](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/AirFighter):**  an air combat game featuring a single level and a final boss.
- **[2D Ray Tracer](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/RayTracer2D)**: a basic 2D ray tracer written in GLSL, with a functional prototype.
- **[Fractal](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/MandelbrotFractal)**: a Mandelbrot fractal rendered using BoxEngine.

### Web development templates

You can find some sample projects showcasing a well-structured full-stack web application — the back-end is available [here](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/TasksAPI) , and the front-end [here](https://github.com/RodrigoPAml/TasksFront-Vite).

The back-end is built with ASP.NET using a clean architecture approach and Domain-Driven Design (DDD) principles. The front-end is a modern React app that consumes this API, following a clean and scalable project structure.
